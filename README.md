**Q: Can I be banned for using this?**
A: Lets break this into 2 types of bans:

- Lunar: While LCQT is theoretically detectable on lunars end, as of right now they do not issue client bans.

A: 
- Cosmetics Unlocker: Unlocks cosmetics for paid Minecraft users.

- FPS Spoof: Spoof your FPS.
- Freelook: Re-enables Freelook and AutoTextHotkey on servers.

**Q: Why isn't cosmetics working on a cracked account?**
A: Because of the way the cosmetics unlocker is implemented you have to be connected to lunars servers for it to work.
